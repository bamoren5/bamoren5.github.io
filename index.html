					<b>Website Project, Writing Intensive Programming (Software Engineering)</b></br>
					For our semester project, we were tasked to build a website that utilized PHP and MySQL. I decided to go with a website that could help other students by providing a place to post questions and/or ideas. In other words, I decided to create a basic discussion forum. You can visit the forum by going to the link below.</br>

					<b>Database Project, Java/Database Management</b></br>
					For this project, we were tasked to make any sort of interactive database system using Java and MySQL. Our database is based around car rentals, you can view, update, and delete various information. You will be acting an administrator of the system. You can view our database code by going to the link below.</br>

					<b>Website Project, Client-Side Web Development</b></br>
					Giving specific guidelines throughout the course we were tasked to make two websites, one individually and one in a group. The first link will take you to the first website we were tasked to make, and the second link will take you to the group website.</br>

					<b>Research Project 1, Java II</b></br>
					Given an image file we were tasked to make two more image files with one of the images being flipped on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. My contribution to the project was figuring out the necessary code to flip the images. You can view my part of the code in the image.java file by downloading the code below.</br>

					<b>iOS/Android Project, Mobile Application Development</b></br>
					Our entire semester for our mobile application development class revolved around making one application that on both iOS and Android. Our team decided to go with a project that, like my discussion forum, be useful for other students. Our application's goal is to help students with basic Java syntax. It does this by showing snippets of code with blank spaces where a specific keyword should go. The keywords being 'if', 'return', 'while', and 'for'.</br>
